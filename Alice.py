# Alice mutually authenticates with Bob, with the assistance of a
# Key Distribution Center (KDC). The specific protocol and encryption mode
# used depends on the commandline parameters. E.g.
#
#   Alice.py -v extended-ns
# uses the extended Needham-Schroeder protocol and Cipher Block Chaining
#   Alice.py -m ecb
# uses the regular Needham-Schroeder protocol and Electronic Code Book encryption
#   Alice.py -m cbc
# uses the regular Needham-Schroeder protocol and Cipher Block Chaining
